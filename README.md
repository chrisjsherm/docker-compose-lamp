# LAMP stack built with Docker Compose

A basic LAMP stack environment built using Docker Compose. It consists of the following:

- PHP

- Configure .env as needed
- Run the `docker-compose` command

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sprintcube/docker-compose-lamp.git
cd docker-compose-lamp/
cp sample.env .env
// modify sample.env as needed
docker-compose up -d
// visit localhost
```

Your LAMP stack is now ready!! You can access it via `http://localhost`.

## Modify this stack before deploying to production

In Production you should modify, at a minimum, the following:

- If you want to support HTTP/2, migrate the php handler: mod_php=> php-fpm
- secure mysql users with proper source IP limitations

## Deployment

Each time you merge a commit to master, a GitHub Actions workflow copies the
following directories to the remote server.

- config
- www

### Secrets

The address of the remote server is defined in this repository's GitHub Secrets.
The credentials for connecting the the remote server are defined there as well.
